Frank's Awesome Media Player

This is just an service I use at home to control my house speakers. We've got speakers built into the kitchen and living room and mounted to the back porch. This lets me turn them on and off from anywhere in the house, and control what they play from my MP3 library. Mostly, I actually end up VNCing in and playing LoFi Girl on youtube, though =]

I have each set of speakers wired up to a separate channel output (e.g. center, rear, etc) which I enable and disable using alsamixer. It's very straight forward, but also very reliable (I think perhaps those things go hand-in-hand more often than not).

As is my preference, it has no dependencies outside of python standard libraries.
